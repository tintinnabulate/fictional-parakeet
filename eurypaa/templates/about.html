<legend>About Bath</legend>

<p class=text-left>
As a former cultural centre of Roman England, Bath is an ideal venue to host EURYPAA in the year following Rome as the host city. Situated less than 15 miles from Bristol in beautiful north Somerset, Bath is a charming and idyllic city steeped in Georgian splendour.

From the Roman Baths and Pump Room and the Bath Abbey to the Royal Crescent, Bathâ€™s tourist attractions are all within a short walk of each other in and around the city centre.  Enjoy a stroll around this compact city and soak in additional sights like the Parade Gardens, Pulteney Bridge and Weir. Adjacent to the Royal Crescent is Royal Victoria Park, 57 acres of both beautifully sculpted and natural landscape housing the Botanical Gardens, adventure playground and even a skatepark!

<h2>Convention Venue</h2>

<p class=text-left>
The facilities at the University of Bath are also world class as it was the home of Team GB for the 2012 Olympics and is host to the 2015 Modern Pentathlon European Championships. There is a 50m olympic pool, full gym, sauna and hydrotherapy, squash, badminton and indoor tennis courts and much more available on a pay and play basis or through a weekly pass. On site is also a cafe and full service restaurant, burger van, and even a supermarket. Rooms are student accommodation and include shared bathroom and ensuite, both at very affordable prices.</p>

<p class=text-left>Frequent bus service from the University to the city centre means it is just a short hop to soak in the sights and spa in the city of Bath just below.</p>

<p class=text-left><b>NB: There are TWO Universities in Bath - <u>The convention venue is at The University of Bath</u>, NOT Bath Spa University.</b></p>
